#About
This is the presentation and the sample code discussed in my presentation on Core Data for the March 2013 CocoaHeads Stockholm meet up. 

The code is intended to be material for learning Core Data so that people who see the presentation can later look at the all the code. You can get the presentation file also from this repo.
